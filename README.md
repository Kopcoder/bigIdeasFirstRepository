Our program simply takes some value from the user, adds 5 to it, and returns it back to the user.

## License
We chose the Academic Free License so that our relatively bare bones code could be built upon
without issue.

## Code of Conduct
The code of conduct outlines acceptable and unacceptable use of the code. This allows
any others that build upon our program to be held accountable for unacceptable use.
